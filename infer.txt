This would be a solid 2.5 stars for me if it that was possible.  It really is smack dab in the middle to me in terms of rating.  The pasta was al dente (yum), the ambiance was nice (especially for being in the middle-of-nowhere Evergreen), and the bread was soft and tasty.  Out of everything we ordered, the lasagna was the better of the 3 dishes - served in a small cast iron pan, it had a nice light crunch to the top and the cheeses had a nice depth of flavors.  But we also had the tomato soup - which lacked something (garlic perhaps?), as well as the Pasta Vongole.  Both were a "meh" for all of us.
