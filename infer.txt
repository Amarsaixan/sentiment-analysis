Came here for a birthday last night. Had reservations at 8. 

The steak was good, but surprisingly the new york had more flavor (seasoning on top). I got the Filet Mignon 6oz. And it was alright. Best cut of meat, but lack of flavor. 

I would say that peppercorn sauce pairs awfully with the New York, and better with the Filet, but it wasn't my favorite sauce. 

The sides: weren't HOT when they came out so I wasn't a huge fan of it. We got the truffle fries, potatoes, mushrooms, mac 'n' cheese.. It was just disappointing.

I mean I guess our steaks came out hot.

But for a 'fancy' ish place: you'd expect better.

We got a platter of raw oysters and I thought it was really good and had no problems, but my cousin's friend Andrew said he kept getting sand/rocks in his.

Service wasn't bad though.

*Don't get the cornbread here: it's awful. The ones at the fairs are better.

I got the Sparking Sangaria: it's not sangria. I knew it was vodka based.. but yeah.. no.

Was the food worth it? Just no.. Spend your money elsewhere.
