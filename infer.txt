This place is in a nice area of Evergreen.  However, food was just OK for the price.
Beef Carpaccio - presentable but hardly any flavor. $19
Pappadelle with meat sauce - tasted like ragu sauce with ground beef. $19
Lamb chops was OK.  Not much flavor other chops. $32
Cocktail drinks _ were OK in a small martini glass a little pricey at $14 each.
Bottle of coke at $5 

Were hoping to find a good Italian restaurant.  Most likely will not come back.
